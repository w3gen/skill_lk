The simplest and fastest WP Cache system

== Description ==

<h4>Official Website</h4>

You can find more information on our web site (<a href="http://www.wpfastestcache.com/">wpfastestcache.com</a>)

When a page is rendered, php and mysql are used. Therefore, system needs RAM and CPU. 
If many visitors come to a site, system uses lots of RAM and CPU so page is rendered so slowly. In this case, you need a cache system not to render page again and again. Cache system generates a static html file and saves. Other users reach to static html page.
<br><br>
In addition, the site speed is used in Google’s search ranking algorithm so cache plugins that can improve your page load time will also improve your SEO ranking.
<br><br>
Setup of this plugin is so easy. You don't need to modify the .htacces file. It will be modified automatically.
